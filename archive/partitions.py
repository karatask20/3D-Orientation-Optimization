# Now we would obtain points on the surface of our object as (x,y,z) tuples and add them to a list, from which we would start building partitions. We create a function that receives as input the aforementioned list and a threshold angle. This last parameter will allow us to determine whether a partition would need support in order to stand still on a surface (e.g. if the inclination of an object is below 45ยบ, it could fall, so it would need external support).

            supp += 1
        total += 1
    return (supp / total) * 100


# This function would return misleading results, as it reads the points on a FCFS basis, and not based on proximity. This is why we should include as a parameter a list/set of partitions instead of a list of points:

    return (supp / total) * 100


# Additionally, we could rescale our problem to work with bigger parts. If we retrieved too many points from a bigger surface, we could just reduce this amount using a recursive function; we would create partitions from our list of points and obtain their centers, in order to work with a shorter list.
